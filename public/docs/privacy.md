(<#key-definitions>) KEY DEFINITIONS

“Aggregate Information” is information that has been combined with information about other users and analyzed or evaluated as a whole, such that no specific individual may be reasonably identified. For example, Aggregate Information may include a statement that says “50% of our users have uploaded medical information in the last 6 months.”

“Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your hard disk by a webpage server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your browser or device, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the Cookie to you.

“Health Care Providers” are providers, doctors, specialists, professionals and other organizations who deliver health care services to you and/or take part in your treatment.

“Health Device Data” is any information that is derived from a mobile device or a wearable fitness tracker that tracks or monitors behavior in a way intended to give the user insight into physical activity and wellness.

“Personal Information” is any information that relates to you directly or indirectly.

“Usage Information” is information that we automatically collect about your device and your use of the Services. This type of information does not usually, by itself, uniquely identify you, but it may still be Personal Information. Usage Information may include your IP address, domain server, type of device(s) and web browser(s) used to access the Services, referring webpage or other source through which you accessed the Services, and other statistics and information associated with the interaction between your browser or device.

“Web Beacons” (also known as “clear GIFs” and “pixel tags”) are small bits of code embedded in web pages or in emails that are used to monitor the behavior of a website user or recipient of an email.

“Your Content” is the information, comments, photos, images, video, data, text, and other content that you may post, upload, store, share, send or display through the Patientory Application. Your Content also includes any copies of or excerpts from medical records and Personal Information that you upload to the Services.

HOW WE COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION

We may collect your information in the following ways:

• When you voluntarily share your information with us. We will ask you to provide us with information in order to access certain features of the Patientory Application. For example, when you create an account for the Patientory Application, we may ask for your name, contact information, birthday, and health information. When you create a profile, we may collect your photos and additional information that you provide to personalize your profile. We may also conduct surveys or polls that request your information.
 

• When you use interactive tools on the Patientory Application. We may collect your information when you use the Patientory Application’s interactive tools, such as uploading copies of and/or excerpts from medical records, and syncing or uploading Health Device Data to the Patientory Application.
 

• When you submit content. Certain features of the Patientory Application may allow you to communicate your Content on public forums or to share it with Health Care Providers. When you share Content in this way, you share it at your own risk.
 

• Automatically through your use of the Patientory Website. When you navigate the Patientory Website, we and our service providers may collect Usage Information through a variety of technical methods, including Cookies, Web Beacons, and other identifiers (collectively, “Data Collection Technologies”). For more information about how we use Data Collection Technologies, please see the Section titled Data Collection Technologies below.

• From social networks and other third parties. We may collect your information from sources other than you, such as from social networks, chat rooms, message boards, other users, and our business partners. If you use or access the Patientory Application or other Patientory Services on or through a social network, we may receive from the social network certain information about you. The information that we receive depends on the social network and your privacy settings with that network. Your interactions with social networks are governed by that network’s privacy statement. You should always review and, if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Patientory Application or other Patientory Services.
If you choose not to provide us with any of your information, you may still be able to access and use some of our Services. Note, however, that certain features of our Services that require your information may not be accessible to you.

HOW YOUR INFORMATION IS STORED

Storage of your Content using the Patientory Application relies on blockchain technology.  This means that Patientory community members who are not affiliated with Patientory, Inc. are incentivized to provide and facilitate access to digital storage space.  This system is designed with the intent that these community members are unable to access unencrypted copies of your Content.  Patientory, Inc. maintains access to the information stored with these third party service providers for analytics and other purposes as described in this Privacy Policy.  Patientory may not have the ability to recover your Content if issues arise in the storage or transfer of this information from community members providing digital storage space for the Patientory Application.  Please refer to the “How We Protect Your Information” section of this Privacy Policy below for more information.

RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION

We keep your information for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws.
