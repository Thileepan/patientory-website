Patientory does not have any obligation with respect to the listing of PTOY on exchanges nor does it have any responsibility with respect to the value or trading of PTOY on exchanges. Any such trading is subject to the contractual terms you agree to with the exchanges and/or sellers, and does not constitute an agreement with Patientory, Inc.

**OUR ENFORCEMENT RIGHTS**

We are not obligated to monitor access or use of the Application, or Your Content or to review or edit any Your Content, but we have the right to do so for the purpose of operating the Application, to ensure compliance with these Terms, and to comply with applicable law or other legal requirements.

We reserve the right (but are not required) to remove or disable access to the Application or Your Content at any time and without notice, and at our sole discretion, if we determine that Your Content, or your use of the Application is objectionable or in violation of these Terms. We have the right to investigate violations of these Terms and any conduct that affects the Application, and in response may take any action we may deem appropriate.

**TERMINATION**

We reserve the right to suspend or deactivate your account or your access to certain aspects of or the entire Application, or to terminate these Terms, at our sole discretion, at any time and without notice or liability to you. Upon any such suspension, deactivation, or termination, we may delete or remove Your Content and other information related to your account.

**INDEMNITY**

You will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Patientory and its officers, directors, employees, affiliates, agents, licensors, and contractors from and against any claims, suits, actions, demands, disputes, allegations, or investigations brought by any third party, governmental authority, or industry body, and all liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your access to or use of the Application, (ii) Your Content, (iii) your breach or alleged breach of any warranties made by you hereunder or your violation of any other provision of these Terms, or (iv) your violation of any law or the rights of a third-party. We reserve the right to assume control of the defense of any third-party claim that is subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses.

**LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

NEITHER PATIENTORY, ITS SUPPLIERS, OR LICENSORS, NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE APPLICATION WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE, OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE APPLICATION, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT PATIENTORY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

IN NO EVENT WILL PATIENTORY’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE APPLICATION, INCLUDING THE STORAGE OR TRANSFER OF PTOY, DASH, OR OTHER TOKENS ON THE APPLICATION, EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).

THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN PATIENTORY AND YOU.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

**DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH US AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.

You agree that any dispute between you and Patientory arising out of or relating to these Terms and the Application (collectively, “Disputes”) will be governed by the arbitration procedure outlined below.

• Governing Law.  Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the Terms and the resolution of any Disputes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia without regard to its conflict of laws principles.
 

• Informal Dispute Resolution. We want to try to address your concerns before engaging in a formal legal dispute. Before filing a claim against Patientory, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting us using the contact information provided in the “How to Contact Us” section below. We’ll try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting you through email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days after submission, you or Patientory may bring a formal proceeding.
 

• We Both Agree To Arbitrate.  You and Patientory agree to resolve any Disputes through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.
 

• Arbitration Procedures.  The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in Atlanta, Georgia, or any other location we agree to.
 

• Arbitration Fees. The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Patientory will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.
 

• Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate. Either you or Patientory may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Fulton County, Georgia. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Application or infringement of intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.
 

• No Class Actions. You may only resolve Disputes with Patientory on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed under our agreement.
 

• Judicial Forum for Disputes. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, in the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Patientory agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of Georgia. Both you and Patientory consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. We both agree to waive our right to a jury trial.
 

• Limitation on Claims. Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of the Application must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or else that claim or cause of action will be barred forever.

**REFERRAL INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSE**

By participating in Patientory, Inc.'s referral or affiliate programs, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Patientory, Inc., its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and licensors from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to:

• Your participation in the referral or affiliate program;

• Any referrals made by you;

• Your breach of these Terms of Service or any applicable laws or regulations;

Any misrepresentation or omission made by you in connection with the referral or affiliate program.

Patientory, Inc. reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate fully with Patientory, Inc. in asserting any available defenses.

**GENERAL TERMS**

Except as otherwise stated herein, these Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Patientory and you regarding the Application, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Patientory and you regarding the Application.

If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

You may not assign, delegate, or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Patientory’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. We may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.

Any notices or other communications provided by Patientory under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) via email or (ii) through the Application. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt on the message will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.

Patientory’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Patientory. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.

**CHANGES TO THESE TERMS**

We reserve the right to modify these Terms. When we update these Terms, we will post a new Effective Date at the top. If we make material changes that would impact your use of the Application, we will endeavor to notify you of the changes prior to the changes taking effect, such as by sending you a notice directly through the Application, by sending an email notification (if you have provided your email address to us), or by any other reasonable method.

**DISCLAIMER**

Maintaining the privacy and security of Your Information is important to us. 1upHealth has implemented appropriate safeguards to prevent unlawful use or disclosure of information. These include administrative, physical, and technical security safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information we receive, maintain, or transmit. Nevertheless, while security of information is of tremendous importance to us, no data transmission (over the internet or any wireless network) or method of electronic storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

In the event of a security breach, we will notify affected individuals, regulatory authorities, and others consistent with requirements under federal and state law or contractual obligations.
